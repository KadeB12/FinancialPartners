         <h3>What We Do</h3>
         <p>We specialize in putting private capital to work through our accredited clients for business purpose loans that borrowers need.

                You need the project funded AND NOW or it dies! Being private, we have the incentive to look at all possible angles to structure the deal in a way that we know an investor (including banks) will be comfortable with it. Not easy. Challenging. Love it!</p>
         
        </div>
        <div class="box2">
                <h3>Who We Are</h3>
                <p>As previous commercial bankers and investment bankers, we had one loan committee to go to and get our loans approved and some ABSOLUTE guidelines for types of projects/businesses we were ok to target for loans.

                        As financiers, we have hundreds of investors of all types (individuals, family offices, banks) that have lending parameters that do the same thing as any loan committee at any bank, BUT they are all different in their parameters and types of deals they like, thus giving us a very broad spectrum of deals we can work with.</p>
                 
        </div>
        <div class="box3">
                <h3>Why We Do What We Do</h3>
                <p>We love business and the entrepreneur in particular. The entrepreneur is tough to get capital for. The HARD DEAL (a deal with hair on it like bad credit, new to the market, low asset owners) is the toughest to get capital for. It takes experience and knowledge in order to be successful consistently. This, in turn, is also a great opportunity for our investors to demand higher returns for the risk they are assuming. It’s not SHARK, its symbiotic. The borrower gets the badly needed capital (debt/equity on any mix) and their project completed profitably (or else we wouldn’t do it) and the Investor gets the alternative investment they are seeking based on the risk they are willing to assume. It’s our pleasure to know the players and set the team up accordingly!</p>
